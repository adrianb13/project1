This page is called "Senate Search"
https://adrianb13.github.io/project1/

You are able to look up the U.S. Senators that represent your state just by entering your city and address.  
It will also tell you how often they vote with party lines, how many they have missed, and how many bills they have sponsored during this current Congressional session or term.

The apis used to help pull the information are:
- The ProPublica Congress API
- Google Civic Information API

The site has room for expansion to pull up your State Legislative Representatives and House of Representatives.  Also during elections, it should have the ability to help you find your polling place.
